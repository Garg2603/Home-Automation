# Home-Automation
This home automation project employs IoT devices, including the NodeMCU and a relay module, integrated with the Blynk platform. The NodeMCU, with Wi-Fi capabilities, connects to the Blynk app, allowing remote control of appliances. The relay module acts as a switch for devices like lights or fans. Through the Blynk app, users can manage and automate their home, enhancing convenience and energy efficiency. This system provides real-time control and monitoring, transforming homes into smart and interconnected spaces using IoT technology.
